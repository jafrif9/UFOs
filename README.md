# UFOs

## Overview
The premise of the project was to create a website to display data pertaining to UFO-sightings. User input would prompt the website to filter through the provided data and display relavent information pertaining to the parameters given.

## Results
To navigate the website, the user needs to click the inboxes on the left and enter their desired parameters. The website will then filter through the data and display the information relavent to the user input in the form of a table with the date, city, state, country, shape, duration, and additional comments. 

## Summary
A potential drawback to the website is the lack of international information, all data on hand is US based. A recommendation for the website moving forward would be to add more colour to the website to make it more inviting. In addition, including international data would be a beneficial improvement for the website moving forward.
